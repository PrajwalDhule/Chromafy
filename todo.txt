TASKS

- generate palette of 5 colors (text and bg very subtle) 
- generate based on color scheme if one is selected
- handle light and dark mode
- handle locking of colors and how it will affect palette generation
- generate shades of the colors with maybe a naming convention like tailwind (red-300, blue-700)
- convert the colors to various formats (rgb, hsl, etc) and variables (css, tailwind, etc) and export
- give naming conventions for both foreground and background for each color (fg-chroma-text-200, bg-chroma-bg)
- apply text color globally (html, input, a) with an option to turn off global application
- rest of the colors, optionally text as well, should be applied to their corresponding classes (original primary color should be applied as a background-color to .bg-chroma-primary)
- first apply the colors in terms of variables to all the required elements, and then for every palette generation, keep changing the variable values
